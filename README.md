# Search Algorithms Package

This Dart package provides implementations of several search algorithms, including binary search, linear search, and jump search. These algorithms are designed to help you efficiently search for elements within lists and strings.

## Features

- **Binary Search**: A fast search algorithm for sorted lists and strings, which works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Linear Search**: A straightforward search algorithm that examines each element sequentially until the desired element is found.
- **Jump Search**: An efficient search algorithm for sorted lists and strings, which jumps ahead by fixed steps and then performs a linear search within the block.

## Getting Started

To start using this package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  search_algorithms: ^1.0.0
